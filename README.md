# üê∂ Happy Paw Pet Sitting
Happy Paw Pet Sitting is a website that allows pet owners to make online bookings for pet sitting services. It also provides customers with a form to submit inquiries.

## Design Process
This website is meant for pet owners who are looking for pet sitting services. Their main goal would be to find out more information on a company, book a service if the company meets their expectations, and contact the company if they have any additional questions.

As such, the website includes the following features:
- **Landing page with carousel and testimonials**: Showcase the company in a positive light to potential customers and show them that the company has been tried and tested by others
- **Services page**: List out the services that Happy Paw Pet Sitting provides
- **Booking page**: Allow customers to submit a request to book certain services
- **Contact page**: Allow customers to submit a form with questions they have
